# Final data analysis project for Biol/Math 218

For this project, you will:
1. Search the internet for publicly available datasets

2. Choose a dataset that you are interested in and provide the following:
   - Background on the data, including how it was collected, why it was collected, and any biological context. (1 - 2 pages with 3-4 citations)
   -  Code needed to import the data in R

3. You then need to formulate and state a thesis question; what are you interested in learning from this dataset?

4. Provide the statistical test(s) that you will perform to answer this question, including justification for the use of those test(s) and their assumptions. 

5. Perform the test in R utilizing the built-in functions and outside libraries() when needed. Analyses need to include proper summary statistics, assumption tests, hypothesis tests, any appropriate post-hoc tests, and graphics (plots, tables, etc). 

**NOTE**: All steps need to be properly documented in your .Rmd project file.

6. Provide the results of your tests and describe the potential biological significance of your results using background on the data and the scientific literature (1 - 2 pages, with 3-4 citations)

7. Present your data, methods, results, and discussion in a short presentation to the class.
