## One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) ########################################

## Question: What are the hypotheses for the ANOVA (assume you have three groups)?

## Answer:


## Question: What are the assumptions of the ANOVA?


## Answer: 


## ANOVA Practice ##############################################################

## You are interested in whether there is a different herbicide treatments impacted
## the growth of corn plants. Using an ANOVA, compare the different treatments (including 
## the control) and make a statement about whether they cause differences in growth. 
## Use the PlantGrowth data set from Portfolio 8.

## Step 1: State the hypotheses


## Step 2: Calculate the appropriate sum of squares (Show all work)


## Step 3: Calculate the mean squares using the sum of squares from Step 2 (Show all work)


## Step 4: Calculate F statistic (Show all work)


## Step 5: Use R to calculate a p-value based on your F


## Step 6: Use the built-in ANOVA function(s) to produce an ANOVA table including
## the SS, MS, F, and p-value(s). 


## Question: What is your decision based on the results of the ANOVA?

## Answer:

## Question: Is it appropriate to run a post hoc test? Why or why not?


## Answer:

## Run a Tukey-Kramer test to compare each group to each other. What are the results 
## and your interpretation?

## Answer:

## Question: Why does the Tukey-Kramer test use adjusted p-values?

## Answer:
