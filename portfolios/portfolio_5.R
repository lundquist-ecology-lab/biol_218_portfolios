##### Hypothesis testing ######################################################

## Identify whether each of the following statements is more appropriate as the 
### null hypothesis or as the alternative hypothesis in a test: 

## Hypothesis: The number of hours highschool spend watching television 
## affects how well they do on standardized tests.

## Answer:

## Hypothesis: Smoking leads to increased chance of developing lung cancer.

## Answer:

## Hypothesis: Eating fast food has no effect on kidney function.

## Answer:

## Hypothesis: Bears do not like honey.

## Answer:

## Hypothesis: Global temperatures are unaffected by increases in 
## carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

## Answer:


## State the most appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for 
## each of the following experiments or observational studies: 

## A test of whether eating candy causes incrased chance of developing cavities

## H_0:
## H_A:

## An experiment to test whethether a pesticide impacts growth rates of a pollinator

## H_0:
## H_A:


## A test of wether mail-in ballots is preferred by older voters

## H_0:
## H_A:


## A test of whether urbanization impacts biodiversity downstream.

## H_0:
## H_A:

## For the example above about urbanization, the researcher found that the 
## average (x_bar) number of insect species downstream was 20 [plus or minus] 5 species  and
## upstream average was 30 [plus or minus] 2 insects. She calculated a P value of 0.015. 
## What is the conclusion that can be drawn from this test? [Note: Exact wording 
## is important here]

##### Type I and Type II error ################################################

## What is Type I error?

## Answer:

## What is Type II error?

## Answer:

## Imagine that you are using a random sample of data to test a null hypothesis. 
## Answer whether the following statement is true or false: A parameter estimate 
## with high sampling error will result in a test with a higher Type I error rate 
## compared to an estimate with low sampling error.

## Answer:

## What effect does reducing the value of the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01 have on 
## the probability of committing a Type I error?

## Answer:

## What effect does reducing the value of the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01 have on 
## the probability of committing a Type II error?

## Answer:
