######################################## Sampling bias ########################################

## Answer the following questions:

# An Environmental Studies student was interested in the attitudes of students at her college about 
# new sustainability practices at the school. She developed a questionnaire and acquired the list of emails 
# for all enrolled students. She randomly selected 500 students from those email lists to send her questionnaire.
# A total of 150 of the 500 questionnaires were filled out and returned to her.

# Can the 150 students that returned questionnaires be considered as a random sample of all students? Explain.

# Answer:

# What type of bias might be at play here? Why?

# Answer:

######################################## Sampling error ########################################

## Which are continuous and which are discrete

# Number of starfish in a tide pool
# Answer:

# Survival time after pesticide treatment?
# Answer:

# Height of college students
# Answer:

# Number of spines on a sea urchin
# Answer:

# Width of redwood tree trunks
# Answer:

## Answer the following questions:

# Measuring biodiversity, the number and type of animals and plants in a given area is
# important for informing conservation efforts. To determine the community composition
# of pollinators in parks in New York City, a researcher placed hundreds of red cup traps
# filled with water around the city to attract and trap pollinators in the summer of 2019. 
# Each cup was checked daily for insects and the water was refilled. The collected
# pollinators were pinned and identified in the lab. At the end of the study,
# the total number of pollinator species (richness) in New York City parks were estimated by
# the total number of pollinators collected during the study. 

# What parameter is being estimated in this pollinator study?

# Answer:

# Is the sample of individuals captured in red cup traps likely to be a random sample?
# Why or why not? Include the two criteria that define a sample as random
# in your answer.

# Answer:

# Is the number of species in the sample likely to be an unbiased estimate? Why or why not?


## Answer the following questions:

# The courtship of male and female fruit flies is complex and can be
# impacted by changes in their environment. A scientist exposed thirty
# male fruit flies to the pesticide Paraquat, which can inhibit neurological
# function, as well as kept thirty males unexposed. She studied whether 
# mating success was different between the two groups.

# Which is the explanatory and which is the response variable?

# Answer:

# For each variable, state whether they are categorical or numeric?

# Answer:

# Is this study observational or experimental?

# Answer:

## Answer the following questions:

# A researcher wanted to compare aquatic insect size in urban and 
# rural streams in upstate New York. The collected individuals of
# the hellgrammite *Nigronia serricornus* in both an urban and
# rural stream sites and weighed them in the lab.
# Which is the explanatory and which is the response variable?

# Answer:

# Which variables are categorical and which are numeric?
