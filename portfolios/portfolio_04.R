####################### Mutually exclusive vs. non-exclusive events ############

# Imagine that you have a population of 100 cats, 40 that are black with long fur, 30 that are white 
# with short fur, 10 that are black with short fur, and 20 that are white with
# long fur.

## Question: Are "black" and "long fur" mutually exclusive traits for this 
## population of cats?

## Answer: 

## Question: Are "white" and "short fur" independent traits for this population of cats?

## Answer:

## A normal deck of cards has 52 cards, consisting of 13 each of four suits: 
## spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Hearts and diamonds are red, while 
## spades and clubs are black. Each suit has an ace, nine cards numbered 2 
## through 10, and three face cards. The face cards are a jack, a queen, and a king. 
## Answer the following questions for a single card drawn at random from a 
## well-shuffled deck of cards.

## Question: What is the probability of drawing a king of any suit?

## Answer: 

## Question:What is the probability of drawing a face card that is also a spade?

## Answer: 

## Question: What is the probability of drawing a card without a number on it?

## Answer:

## Question: What is the probability of drawing an ace? 

## Answer:

## Question: What is the probability of drawing a red ace? 

## Answer:

## Question: Are these events ("ace" and "red") mutually exclusive? Are they independent?

## Answer: 

## Question: List two possible events that are mutually exclusive for a single draw from a deck of cards.

## Answer: 

####################### General addition principle #############################

## When asked about their thoughts on the movie the Batman, 
## 20% of movie-goers said that it was "excellent", 
## 10% said that it was "pretty good"," 53% were "indifferent," 
## 16% said that "it was pretty bad" and 1% said it was "especially horrible". 
## Only one answer per movie-goer was allowed.

## ***When asked to use a probability rule make sure to write out the probability equation first***
## Example: Pr[X or Y] = Pr[X] + Pr[Y]

## Question: Are these five possible answers mutually exclusive? Explain.

## Answer: 

## Question: What is the probability that a movie-goer had a positive review of this movie?

## Answer: 

## Question: What is the probability that a movie-goer would review the movie as anything but 
## are anything other than especially horrible?

## Answer: 

####################### General multiplication principle #######################

## Of a population of males, 60% were smokers. Suppose that men that smoke have
## a probability 20.7% of developing lung cancer during their lifetime. In contrast, men who 
## did not smoke had a 1.3% lifetime chance of developing lung cancer.

## ***When asked to use a probability rule make sure to write out the probability equation first***

## Question: What is the conditional probability of of a man from this population getting cancer, given that they smoked?

## Answer: 

## Question: Calculate the probability that a member of this population both smoked and 
## eventually developed lung cancer.

## Answer: 

## Question: Using the general multiplication rule, calculate the probability that a 
## member of this population both did not smoke and never developed lung cancer.

## Answer: 

####################### Bayes' Theorem #########################################

## Step by step, calculate the probability that a man from the population above smoked, given that he had been 
## diagnosed with lung cancer below: 

## ***When asked to use a probability rule make sure to write out the probability equation first***

## Question: Write Bayes' theorem for the case described in this question.

## Answer: 

## Question: Calculate the probability that a man in this population would 
## develop lung cancer in his lifetime. (Use the law of total probability.)

## Answer: 

## Question: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a man from this population 
## smoked, given that he eventually developed lung cancer.

## Answer:
