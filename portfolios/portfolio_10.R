## All R code needs to work properly, so double check your work!

## Data transformations ########################################################

## Using the petal length data of Iris setosa and Iris versicolor from the 
## iris dataset perform the following transformations and provide an assessment 
## of the efficacy of each one, including any appropriate graphics. (NOTE: you should
## use the same transformation for both sets of observations)

## 1) log transformation


## 2) square-root transformation


## 3) reciprocal transformation


## Using the "best" of these transformations, test the following hypothesis: Iris 
## setosa petals are longer than Iris versicolor petals in the space below. 
## Make sure to report and compare the petal lengths of each in your conclusion.


### Non-parametric tests #######################################################

## Use the sign test to answer this question: The weights of fifty mice were
## measured before and after an antibiotic treatment. Thirty seven of fifty mice 
## lost weight after treatment. Does the antibiotic cause weight loss?



## Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to answer the following question: Do
## Iris setosa and Iris virginica sepal lengths differ significantly? 


## Use the Kruskal-Wallace test to answer the following question: Do the petal widths
## differ among the different Iris species? 


## If there are differences, which ones are different?
