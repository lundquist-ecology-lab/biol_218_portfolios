## Note: All text that is not r code needs to be commented out using the "#", this includes
## all notes and answers to questions. 
## All R code needs to work properly, so double check your work!

### Correlation ################################################################ 

## Question: What are the hypotheses for a correlation?

## Answer:

## Question: What are the assumptions?

## Answer:


## Question: For every three credit-hour class, students approximately 48 hours
## spent in class during a 16 week semester. While many students attend class
## regularly, some do not and it is thought that this impacts their
## performance in the glass (measured by their final grade out of 100).

## The grades and total amount of time spend in class pf fifteen students 
## in an introductory chemistry class were collected below:

## Total hours in class: 42, 48, 48, 30, 24, 48, 33, 45, 42, 48, 15, 21, 30, 48, 42

## Final grade out of 100: 90, 82, 92, 65, 40, 72, 55, 88, 82, 70, 35, 88, 82, 95, 91

## Part 1: Display the relationship between arrival dates of males and females in a graph.

## Part 2: Describe the pattern in part (a) briefly. Is there a relationship? 
## Is it positive or negative? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it weak or strong? 

## Part 3: Using a Spearman correlation in R, estimate the correlation coefficient (r)
## and state whether the correlation is significant. What is the biological significance
## of this?

### Regression #################################################################

## Question: What are the hypotheses for linear regression?

## Answer:

## Question: What are the assumptions?

## Answer:

## Soil nutrients are important for plant growth and nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus) 
## can be added to soil to increase plant growth. However, does nutrient
## addition increase plant biodiversity? Researchers wanted to test this and
## added either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 additional nutrients to a plot 
## allowed the plants to grow, and recorded the total number of
## plant species found within the plot. The data is below:

## Nutrients added: 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4
## Number of plant species: 36, 36, 32, 34, 33, 30, 20, 23, 21, 16

## Part 1: Produce a scatter plot of these data. Which variable should be 
## the explanatory variable (X), and which should be the response variable (Y)?

## Part 2: Use the lm() function to produce the line of best fit and overlay it on 
## your plot.

## Part 3: What percentage of the variation in the number of plant species is 
## "explained" by the number of nutrients added?

## Part 4: Test the null hypothesis of not treatment effect on the number of plant
## species.

## Part 5: What is the impact of nutrient addition on plant richness? Is there an ecological
## explanation for this? (Warning: These are nutrients, not toxic materials, so that is not
## the explanation)
